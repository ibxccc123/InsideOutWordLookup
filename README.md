# InsideOutWordLookup
A C++ binary search algorithm that searches up instances of matching "inside-out words" within an input text file.

An inside-out word is created by splitting a word in half, reversing both halves, and joining them back afterwards.

Ex: 
String A: "conner"  -> parsed and updated into "nocren"
